# Honor code #
I stand in a position to testify that honor code was not violated. I did not see any of my peers cheat nor did I.
I struggled with the code until it became to life by myself, thanks to the office hours!.

# Extra credit #
It was not easy to come up with an extra credit but I tried to at least increase the speed of the ball every 4 times it bounces
from the paddle.

# Looking forward #
My appreciation goes to whoever gathered the challenge and of cause
the facilitators that are helping us to crack through the challenges.
I am looking forward to see more challenges like this because
they are making me to realize that I can actually try, that I bear a lot in me.
